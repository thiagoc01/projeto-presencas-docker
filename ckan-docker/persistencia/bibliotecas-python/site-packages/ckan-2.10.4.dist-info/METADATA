**CKAN is the worldâ€™s leading open-source data portal platform**.
CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management
system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing
datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization
tools and more. Read more at `ckan.org <http://ckan.org/>`_.
